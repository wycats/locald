## Why locald?

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Zero Config Ports" icon="puzzle">
		Forget `PORT=3000`. `locald` assigns ports dynamically and injects them into your app.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Process Management" icon="rocket">
		Run your backend, frontend, and workers as background services. No more terminal tab explosion.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Local Domains" icon="magnifier">
		Access your apps via `app.local` instead of `localhost:45231`. (Coming Soon)
	</Card>
	<Card title="Interaction Modes" icon="open-book">
		Designed for Developers, Operators, and Observers.
	</Card>
</CardGrid>
