title: Your First Workspace
description: From zero to running services with clean URLs.
---

This tutorial gets you from “nothing running” to a working local service with:

- a free port via `$PORT`
- a supervised process (auto-restart, logs captured)
- a stable `*.localhost` URL
- a dashboard at `http://locald.localhost`

## 1. Installation

Currently, `locald` is built from source.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wycats/dotlocal.git
cd dotlocal
cargo install --path locald-cli
```

Before going deeper, it’s worth knowing the core “taught model” vocabulary is intentionally small.
See the Surface Contract (RFC 0114) for what’s **Stable** vs **Experimental**.

## 2. The "Hello World" Moment

Let's start with something ephemeral. You don't need a config file to see `locald` in action.

```bash
locald try python3 -m http.server $PORT
```

**What just happened?**

1.  **Port Management**: `locald` assigned a random, free port to your process and injected it as `$PORT`. No more "Address already in use" errors.
2.  **Process Supervision**: Your command isn’t just running in your shell; it’s supervised by the `locald` daemon.
3.  **Graceful Shutdown**: Press `Ctrl+C`. `locald` catches the signal and shuts down the process cleanly.

It will ask if you want to save this service. For now, say **No**. We'll build a real project next.

## 3. Defining the Source of Truth

A `locald` project starts with a `locald.toml` file. It defines _what_ should run, not _how_ to run it.

Create a directory for your new project:

```bash
mkdir my-app
cd my-app
```

Initialize the workspace:

```bash
locald init
```

Follow the prompts. For this example, let's create a simple web service:

- **Project Name**: `my-app`
- **Service Name**: `web`
- **Command**: `python3 -m http.server $PORT`

This generates a `locald.toml` that looks like this:

```toml
[project]
name = "my-app"

[services]
web = { command = "python3 -m http.server $PORT" }
```

## 4. Bringing Up the Workspace

Now, let's bring the platform to life.

```bash
locald up
```

Unlike `npm start` or `make run`, `locald up` doesn’t block your terminal with application logs. It asks the background daemon to make reality match what’s in `locald.toml`.

- The daemon starts your `web` service.
- It captures `stdout` and `stderr`.
- It keeps the service running (restarting it if it crashes).

Your terminal is now free. You can close it, open a new one, or walk away. Your workspace persists.

## 5. The Dashboard

To see what's happening, we need observability. `locald` provides a rich web interface that acts as your cockpit.

Visit **[http://locald.localhost](http://locald.localhost)**.

This is your **Workspace**.

<div class="screenshot-wide">

</div>

- **The Rack** (Left): See all your running services at a glance.
- **The Stream** (Center): A unified timeline of logs from all services.
- **The Deck**: Pin services into a focused, tiled layout.
- **System Plane**: Pin `locald` itself (via “System Normal”) to view daemon logs and status.
- **Control**: Start, stop, or restart services with a click.

_Tip: You can also use `locald monitor` for a terminal-based version of this dashboard._

## 6. HTTPS (optional)

If you want HTTPS locally (with real-looking domains), `locald` can set that up too.

First, perform a **one-time system setup** to trust the local Certificate Authority:

```bash
locald admin setup
```

Now, update your `locald.toml` to claim a domain:

```toml
[project]
name = "my-app"
domain = "my-app.localhost"  # <--- Add this line

[services]
web = { command = "python3 -m http.server $PORT" }
```

Run `locald up` again to apply the changes.

Open **[https://my-app.localhost](https://my-app.localhost)**.
You now have a secure, domain-bound service running locally.

## 7. Next Steps

You have a running workspace. Where to next?

- **[Add a Database](/guides/managed-services/)**: Need Postgres or Redis? Don't install them; let `locald` manage them.
- **[Configure Your Stack](/guides/project-setup/)**: See examples for Node, Python, Go, and Rust.
- **[Learn the Dashboard Model](/concepts/workspace/)**: Rack, Stream, Deck, and the System Plane.
