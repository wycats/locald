Draft and lock the v1 user-facing Surface Contract.

Deliverable
- A concrete list of verbs/nouns we commit to teaching as “real” (CLI + docs vocabulary).
- Prefer the smallest set that matches the current product reality.
- Explicitly identify what is out-of-scope / not yet promised.

Acceptance
- Contract is written down in a single place (likely RFC 0114 + docs entry point).
- Terms are consistent with existing CLI help and docs."""

Define stability labels that govern what appears in docs/UI/help.

Deliverable
- A minimal label set (e.g. Stable / Experimental) with rules for:
  - where experimental surfaces can appear
  - how promotion works
  - who can change labels and under what criteria
- A “vocabulary lock” rule: adding new user-facing terms requires reuse or an RFC.

Acceptance
- The rules are easy to apply during doc/CLI updates.
- There is a single canonical description to link to from other docs."""

Apply the Surface Contract + stability labels to the user-facing docs.

Deliverable
- Update “front door” docs to use only contract terms.
- Ensure any experimental/unstable surfaces are explicitly labeled and not over-taught.

Acceptance
- Getting Started and CLI reference match the contract vocabulary.
- Any mention of experimental features is consistently labeled and points to the canonical governance section."""
