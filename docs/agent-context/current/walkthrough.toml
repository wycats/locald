description = "Add env provenance to config show"
details = """
Implemented minimal, truthful env provenance: added pure env layer merge/provenance helpers in locald-core; updated locald-server config loader to build Global/Context/Workspace/.env env layers and produce an env provenance report; updated Global Configuration:
  Path: "/home/wycats/.config/locald/config.toml"
  Values: GlobalConfig {
    server: ServerConfig {
        privileged_ports: true,
        fallback_ports: true,
    },
} to print server config provenance and env sources plus per-service overrides."""

type = "feat"
description = "Extend config provenance to service fields"
details = """
Added service-field provenance to `locald config show --provenance` for:
- services.<name>.command
- services.<name>.workdir
- services.<name>.port
- services.<name>.depends_on

Implementation:
- Added `ConfigLoader::load_service_provenance_report` (server-side) to report these fields and their source config path.
- Updated the CLI to print `[services.<name>]` sections with per-field `(from <path>)` when `--provenance` is set.
- Added a unit test in `locald-server` to ensure the source path is the discovered project config path.

Verification:
- `cargo test -p locald-server`
- `./scripts/verify-phase.sh`

Notes:
- This is intentionally minimal and truthful: it reports provenance for values we currently load (project config path), without claiming Context/Workspace provenance for service fields yet."""

type = "feat"
description = "Implement service config cascade"
details = """
Implemented RFC 0026 merging rules for service fields:
- Added LayerConfig to parse intermediate config layers (Global, Context, Workspace).
- Implemented discover_layers to walk up the directory tree.
- Implemented merge_service_configs with 'replace' strategy for scalars and depends_on, and 'merge' for env.
- Updated ConfigLoader to load and merge upstream configs into project config.
- Updated service provenance report to track source of each field across layers.
- Added unit test verifying cascading behavior."""
