type = "design"
description = "RFC 0111: property tests as invariant specs"
details = "Created Stage-0 RFC 0111 to formalize invariant-driven property testing for doctor/capability readiness and fix consolidation; updated manual testing strategy and RFC 0109/0110 to call out soundness + drift-prevention invariants."

[[entries]]
type = "test"
description = "Lock down RunAdminSetup canonical remediation"
details = "Added a property test in locald-utils ensuring FixKey::RunAdminSetup is dominant when present and its commands list is exactly 'sudo locald admin setup'."

[[entries]]
type = "test"
description = "Fix consolidation semantic proptests"
details = "Added semantic property tests for fix consolidation completeness (no dropped fix keys) and monotonicity under added failing problems, matching precedence-not-subsumption semantics in RFC 0111."

[[entries]]
type = "test"
description = "JSON roundtrip preserves doctor semantics"
details = "Added a property test asserting that DoctorReport JSON roundtrip preserves has_critical_failures() and the sets of fix keys (from failing problems and from fixes)."

[[entries]]
type = "design"
description = "Phase 99 docs: systemd detection and kill semantics"
details = "Updated RFC 0099 and the resource-management manual to match current implementation: systemd presence is determined by PID 1 (/proc/1/comm) to avoid /run false positives; cgroup kill fallback is best-effort recursive cgroup.procs enumeration (no freezer semantics)."

[[entries]]
type = "test"
description = "Sandbox identity stable default"
details = "Added Phase 99 TDD coverage ensuring LOCALD_SANDBOX_ACTIVE without LOCALD_SANDBOX_NAME still yields a deterministic sandbox name (default), avoiding cgroup path instability in older environments."

[[entries]]
type = "test"
description = "Phase 99 acceptance: document sanitization"
details = "Added a small test guarding RFC 0099 + the resource-management manual against drift: acceptance criteria now explicitly state cgroup name sanitization rules matching the implemented generator."
