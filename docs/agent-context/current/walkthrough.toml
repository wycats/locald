description = "Generate deterministic CLI surface manifest"
details = """
- Added hidden internal CLI command `locald __surface cli-manifest` to emit a stable JSON representation of the clap command tree.
- Implemented clap->manifest conversion in `locald-cli/src/surface_manifest.rs` (commands, subcommands, args, aliases, hidden/global, positional).
- Checked in the canonical manifest at `docs/surface/cli-manifest.json`."""

type = "feat"
description = "Lint docs locald snippets against manifest"
details = """
- Added `scripts/check-cli-surface-docs.mjs` to scan shell code fences in root README and `locald-docs` content for `locald ...` invocations.
- Validates command/subcommand paths and only the *leading* flags against `docs/surface/cli-manifest.json` (stops parsing flags at first positional argument to avoid false positives like `python3 -m ...`).
- Integrated into existing docs checks so docs drift fails fast."""

type = "feat"
description = "Enforce surface contract in CI"
details = """
- Updated `scripts/check` and GitHub Actions workflows to:
  - regenerate CLI manifest and fail if it differs from `docs/surface/cli-manifest.json`
  - run the docs CLI surface linter
- Ran `exo verify` to confirm rustfmt, clippy, dashboard build, docs checks, and IPC verification are green."""
