details = """
Verified WebSocket upgrade end-to-end using examples/websocket-test.

Steps:
- Started sandbox server: `./target/debug/locald --sandbox=phase-16-ws server start`
- Registered + started the project: `./target/debug/locald --sandbox=phase-16-ws up examples/websocket-test`
- locald bound HTTPS on the fallback port (8443) because privileged ports + setuid shim are not configured.
- Ran the client: `LOCALD_HTTPS_PORT=8443 pnpm run client`

Result:
- Client connected and received echo: `received: hello`"""
