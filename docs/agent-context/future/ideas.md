## Documentation Overhaul
- **Goal**: Update docs to better serve specific user personas.
- **Action**: Create `docs/design/personas.md` to define target users.
- **Proposed Personas**:
    - **"Regular Joe" (The App Builder)**: Just wants to build apps. Needs simple "how-to" guides, copy-paste configs, and clear error messages. Doesn't care about the internal architecture.
    - **"The Power User" (The System Tweaker)**: Wants to customize ports, domains, and environment variables. Needs detailed reference docs.
    - **"The Contributor" (The Rustacean)**: Wants to hack on `locald` itself. Needs architecture diagrams and internal API docs.
- **Action**: Fresh eyes review of the documentation site's purpose based on these personas.
