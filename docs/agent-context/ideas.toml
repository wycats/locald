Extend provenance beyond env and beyond project-only sources:

- Implement RFC 0026 “crisp rules” merge for service fields across Global/Context/Workspace/Project where applicable:
  - Scalars (port/command/workdir): replace
  - depends_on: replace
- Track per-field provenance (which layer + which file) for each resolved service value.
- Extend `locald config show --provenance` to show the full cascade for these fields.

Non-goals for the first slice:
- Secrets providers and resource injection provenance (can be a follow-up)."""

Consider splitting configuration inheritance into two concepts:

This resolves the ambiguity where defining a service in the workspace config currently implies both 'default values for children' and 'a runnable service at the workspace level'."""
