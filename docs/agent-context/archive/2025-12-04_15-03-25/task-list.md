# Phase 25: Roadmap & Design Organization

**Goal**: Organize the `docs/design` directory into structured phases in priority order. Ensure the roadmap is a good reflection of goals and the right order to achieve them in.

## Tasks

- [ ] **Inventory**: Audit all files in `docs/design`.
- [ ] **Prioritization**: Discuss and rank features/phases with the user.
- [ ] **Restructure**: Organize design docs into a folder structure that mirrors the roadmap (e.g., `docs/design/epoch-3/`).
- [ ] **Plan Update**: Update `plan-outline.md` to reflect the agreed priorities.
