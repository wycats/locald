# Phase 11 Walkthrough: Documentation & Persona Alignment

## Overview
In this phase, we are pausing feature development to ensure our documentation is up to par. We are reviewing all docs through the lens of our Personas.

## Key Decisions

### 1. Persona-First Documentation
We are structuring the documentation to explicitly serve the "App Builder", "Power User", and "Contributor" personas, rather than just having a flat list of topics.
