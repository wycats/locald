# RFC: Documentation: Persona-Based Structure

## 1. Summary

Documentation shall be structured explicitly around three personas: App Builder, Power User, and Contributor.

## 2. Motivation

Documentation was becoming a mix of tutorials and references without a clear audience. Different users have different needs.

## 3. Detailed Design

- **Power User**: Reference, Configuration.
- **Contributor**: Internals, Architecture.

### Terminology

- **Persona**: A user archetype.

### User Experience (UX)

Clearer navigation in the docs site.

### Architecture

Docs folder structure.

### Implementation Details

Astro Starlight sidebar configuration.

## 4. Drawbacks

- Duplication of information (sometimes).

## 5. Alternatives

- Flat structure.

## 6. Unresolved Questions

None.

## 7. Future Possibilities

None.
