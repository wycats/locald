A brief explanation of the feature and the problem it solves.

## 2. Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody familiar with the project to understand, and for somebody familiar with the implementation to implement.

### Terminology

Define any new terms.

### User Experience (UX)

How will the user interact with this feature? (CLI commands, Config files, UI changes).

- [ ] Task 2

## 5. Context Updates (Stage 3)

List the changes required to `docs/manual/` to reflect this feature as "current reality".

- [ ] Create/Update `docs/manual/features/xxx.md`
- [ ] Update `docs/manual/architecture/xxx.md`
- [ ] Update `docs/agent-context/plan-outline.md`

## 6. Drawbacks

Why should we _not_ do this?

## 6. Alternatives

What other designs have been considered?

## 7. Unresolved Questions
