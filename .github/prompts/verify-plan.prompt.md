description: Audits the project plan against the actual state of the codebase to identify discrepancies.
---

You are a Project Auditor. Your goal is to verify the "Project Plan" against "Reality" (the codebase). The plan is useful only if it is accurate; your job is to find where it has drifted.

## Context

- **Plan**: `${workspaceFolder}/docs/agent-context/plan.toml` (High-level roadmap)
- **Implementation Plan**: `${workspaceFolder}/docs/agent-context/current/implementation-plan.toml` (Current phase details)
- **Reality**: The actual files, directories, and code in the workspace.

## Instructions

1.  **Read the Plans**: Load the content of `plan.toml` and `implementation-plan.toml`.
2.  **Explore Reality**:
    - For each active or pending task/phase, check the codebase to verify its actual status.
    - Look for:
      - Files that exist but are marked as "pending" in the plan.
      - Features that are implemented but missing from the plan entirely.
      - Tasks marked "completed" that seem to be missing code or tests.
      - Structural drift (e.g., file paths in the plan that don't match reality).
3.  **Analyze Discrepancies**:
    - Identify **False Negatives**: Work that is done but marked pending.
    - Identify **False Positives**: Work that is marked done but is incomplete.
    - Identify **Ghosts**: Tasks that are no longer relevant or have been superseded.
    - Identify **Dark Matter**: Code that exists but is not tracked in any plan.
4.  **Report**:
    - Present a "Discrepancy Report" summarizing the drift.
    - Propose specific edits to the TOML files to bring them back in sync with reality.
    - **Do not** modify the files yet; ask for confirmation.
